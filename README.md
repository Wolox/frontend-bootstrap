Frontend Bootstrap
===============

Kickoff for web applications.

## Main Tools
+ [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
+ [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)
+ [Pug](https://pugjs.org)
+ [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)

## First steps
#### Installing node
Get the latest version of node from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/) or using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
Nvm approach is preferred. Also, you may find this [tool](https://github.com/wbyoung/avn) useful to automate version changing between projects.

#### Getting the dev dependencies
Run `npm install` from rootpath of the project.

## Development

#### Environments
By default, the environment will be **development**, but you can easily change it using the **env** param in your gulp tasks: ```gulp --env production```

#### SCSS
When creating SCSS files you don't need to import other files inside yours to use properties from them. There's a specific file called `application.scss` where every SCSS file should be imported in the desired priority order. This works just like the stylesheet elements in the head of an html, when repeated rules are present the rule that was imported last will override the other.

#### Vendors
To add a vendor simply install and save it using npm. Then add the path of the source files relative to the **node_modules** folder, to **vendorJs.js** or **vendorCss.js** depending on what you are adding.
i.e: Adding jquery
```bash
npm install --save jquery
```
This will generate the **jquery** folder inside **node_modules** and add the register the dependency in the `package.json` file. Then, add the source file of jquery to **vendorJs.js**. It should look like this:
```
module.exports = [
  'jquery/dist/jquery.js',
];
```

#### Testing

##### Unit testing
We combine the power of [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) and [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) frameworks to develop our unit testing. You can find the configuration files in the `test/unit` folder and you can find the tests inside the `test/unit/specs` folder.
To run these specs execute the following: `npm run test`

##### End to end tests

We combine the power of Protractor and Jasmine frameworks to develop our end to end tests. You can find the configuration files in the test/e2e folder and you can find the tests inside the test/e2e/specs folder.

The first time you are running the tests, you probably need to update webdriver. Use the following: `./node_modules/.bin/webdriver-manager update`
To run these specs against the url in the protractor conf execute the following: `npm run protractor`
To run these specs against your development environment, execute the following: `npm run protractor-local`. This will hit the app in `localhost:3000`.

## Deploy

#### S3
In order to deploy you must first create **aws.js** file with the credentials of the Amazon S3 bucket for each environment.
The file needs to have to follow the format specified in *config/aws.js.example*

Then just run `aws-deploy --env <environment name>` with your desired env as parameter.

Finally, you need to add a custom routing rule so that s3 handles the 404 (or 403 depending or the bucket policy) to the s3 properties. In the **Static Website Hosting** panel, check the **Enable website hosting** option and complete the form with the following:
```
Index document: index.html
```
And add this redirect rule (Depending on the bucket policy the error code to handle can be either 404 or 403)
```
<RoutingRules>
    <RoutingRule>
        <Condition>
            <HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals>404</HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals>
        </Condition>
        <Redirect>
            <ReplaceKeyPrefixWith>#/</ReplaceKeyPrefixWith>
        </Redirect>
    </RoutingRule>
</RoutingRules>
```
